## What is TAO Bittensor?

Bittensor is a decentralized infrastructure for building and deploying machine learning models on the blockchain. It offers a significant advantage in that it enables Machine Learning models to be trained and shared on a larger scale by leveraging blockchain computing power. The system is designed to incentivize the production of machine intelligence by rewarding performance with TAO.

TAO is the native cryptocurrency token of the Bittensor platform. It is used as a means of exchange within the network to incentivize users to contribute resources such as computing power and data for the training and deployment of machine learning models.

The Bittensor network consists of nodes, each equipped with a unique machine-learning model. These nodes work together to analyze and interpret large collections of text data, with the goal of extracting meaningful insights. Through a consensus mechanism, Bittensor incentivizes nodes in its network to produce valuable machine learning models, with the digital token (TAO) becoming equivalent in value to the representational knowledge within the system. The ultimate goal is to create a decentralized and fair marketplace for artificial intelligence.


## How does the Bittensor Protocol work?

One of the most remarkable features of the Bittensor protocol is its incentivization mechanism. It rewards users who contribute valuable data or computational resources with TAO tokens.

The network is composed of two types of nodes: Servers and Validators. Validators are responsible for verifying the performance of Servers by requesting information and evaluating their responses. These evaluations are transmitted to the Nakamoto blockchain, where the currency is distributed. Meanwhile, Servers strive to optimize their responses in order to compete with other Servers for positive evaluations and a share of the limited supply of TAO currency. The most effective Servers will receive a larger portion of the TAO that is minted.

To begin the validation process, a Validator sends a tokenized text to a Server it has located on the network. The Server responds with logits, representing its best attempt at predicting the next token. This process is the primary value-generating activity on the network. The Validator then scores the Server based on its response, using a variety of information-based techniques and game theory strategies to assess the usefulness of the information received.

When registering on the network, users can choose which role they want to play. Their node will be created as a model, a wallet with two keys, and a customized dataset, allowing them to participate and contribute knowledge to the network.

Overall, the Bittensor protocol represents a breakthrough in the field of collaborative machine learning. Its decentralized nature, incentivization mechanism and focus on collaboration make it a powerful tool.

## What is the Consensus Mechanism of TAO Bittensor?

The consensus mechanism is designed to reward valuable nodes in the network at an increasing rate, rather than relying on a single transaction for the distribution of TAO currency. Once individual scores are calculated, the network blockchain uses a consensus algorithm to determine the most valuable participants and reward them accordingly, while also discouraging malicious activity by nodes in the network.

For Servers to receive rewards, they must perform well in producing valuable knowledge and be useful to the majority of Validators in the network. Meanwhile, Validators are motivated to collaborate with highly valuable Servers that are trusted by the majority of the network through a bonding mechanism and a restriction on the number of scores they can give.

## What is Proof of Intelligence?

Proof of Intelligence is a consensus mechanism used in the Bittensor network to reward nodes that contribute valuable machine-learning models and outputs to the network. It is a variation of the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms used in blockchain networks, but instead of solving complex mathematical problems, nodes are required to perform machine learning tasks to demonstrate their intelligence. The more accurate and valuable the output of a node’s machine learning model, the higher the chance of being selected to add a new block to the chain and receiving rewards in the form of TAO tokens.

## Which problem does Bittensor want to solve?

### Transparency

Bittensor addresses a key concern in the AI industry, which is the centralization of control and the potential for censorship by a single entity. Unlike many existing AI systems, Bittensor is decentralized and open-source, allowing for greater transparency and community-driven development. This approach ensures that the AI models are not controlled by a central entity and can be developed and shared freely by anyone on the network.

### Leverage Artificial Intelligence

Bittensor leverages AI in a decentralized manner by using a network of computers around the world to train and develop machine learning and AI models via the Bittensor network. This means that as more participants join the network, the more computing power and resources become available, allowing for more efficient and accurate AI processing.

In contrast, a central company typically relies on a large centralized supercomputer to solve machine learning problems. Bittensor’s approach allows for a more efficient use of computing resources, while also democratizing the AI industry and allowing for more widespread participation and innovation.

## What is the Goal of Bittensor?

The goal of Bittensor is to create a truly decentralized platform for artificial intelligence and machine learning that leverages the power of blockchain technology. By allowing anyone to contribute compute power to the network and earn rewards in the form of TAO tokens, Bittensor aims to democratize the AI industry and make it more accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers.

Ultimately, the vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence that is fair, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

> Big companies like IBM, Google or Microsoft, but also smaller ones, will pay TAO to use the various models inside the Bittensor network for their own projects.

The reason why big companies like IBM, Google, or Microsoft, as well as smaller ones, would pay TAO to use the various models inside the Bittensor network for their own projects, is because the centralized AI industry is highly ineffective. For instance, Google alone spends 75% of its electrical cost only on machine learning today. As AI research compounds itself every year and new models have to relearn what previous models already learned, these companies will likely find it advantageous to use the most effective and largest neural network in the world provided by Bittensor as an addition to their own machine learning networks.


## Why Decentralized AI matter?

Decentralized AI matters for several reasons. First, it addresses the issue of centralization, where a few large companies control the majority of AI development, data, and processing power. Decentralization allows for a more distributed network of individuals and organizations to contribute to and benefit from AI development.

Second, decentralized AI networks can be more efficient in terms of energy consumption and computing power. Instead of relying on a few large data centers, decentralized networks can leverage the unused computing power of individual devices, reducing waste and cost.

Third, decentralized AI networks can be more secure and resistant to attacks, as they do not rely on a single point of failure. The distributed nature of the network makes it more difficult for malicious actors to compromise the system.

Finally, decentralized AI networks have the potential to be more inclusive and democratized, as anyone with access to computing power and data can participate in AI development and benefit from its advancements. This can lead to a more diverse and equitable AI ecosystem.

## What is the total supply of Bittensor?

The total supply of Bittensor TAO (TAO) is 21 million tokens, which is the same as the total supply of Bitcoin. This fixed total supply is designed to limit inflation and maintain the scarcity and value of the token over time.

The distribution of TAO tokens is gradually released over time through mining rewards, staking rewards, and community-driven initiatives. The tokens are used for governance, staking, and as a means of payment for accessing AI services and applications built on the Bittensor TAO network.

## Why Bittensor is Pursuing Integration with the Polkadot Ecosystem

One of the key reasons for Bittensor’s integration with the Polkadot ecosystem is interoperability. Polkadot’s unique architecture allows for seamless communication and transfer of value between different blockchains in the ecosystem, making it a natural fit for Bittensor’s decentralized infrastructure for building and deploying machine learning models on the blockchain.

The Substrate framework is a key component of the Polkadot ecosystem, and it provides several benefits for Bittensor’s integration. Firstly, Substrate allows Bittensor to develop its own custom blockchain and consensus mechanism.

This means that Bittensor can design a blockchain that is tailored specifically to its needs, enabling it to optimize for performance, security, and other key factors. This level of customization is not typically possible with off-the-shelf blockchain solutions.

Substrate also enables Bittensor to easily communicate and transact with other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem. This is because the framework provides a standardized set of protocols and interfaces that other projects can use to interact with Bittensor’s blockchain. This can help to streamline the process of collaboration and interoperability between different projects, as well as increase the overall value and utility of the Polkadot ecosystem as a whole.

As part of the ecosystem, Bittensor can leverage Polkadot’s cross-chain messaging and token transfer capabilities, allowing it to exchange its native token (TAO) with other tokens in the ecosystem. This can help to unlock new opportunities for collaboration and partnership with other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, and it can also provide additional liquidity and utility for the TAO token.

The alternatives that Bittensor considered were layer 2 solutions such as Ethereum, which were deemed too expensive, and building their own blockchain from scratch, which was deemed too much work and not within their expertise.

Cosmos was a potential option but it did not offer the ability to do forkless runtime upgrades at the time, and it used GO as its language, which was less versatile than Rust.

Ultimately, Bittensor chose Substrate because it provided the necessary level of control and flexibility while also not requiring them to reinvent the wheel. Rust was also deemed to be the most versatile language for their needs. Additionally, the leadership of Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of Ethereum and the creator of Polkadot, was seen as a positive factor.

## Does TAO have its own Wallet?

Bittensor’s TAO token does not have its own dedicated wallet, but it can be stored and managed in compatible wallets that support the Polkadot ecosystem. The  [Polkadot JS Wallet](https://polkadot.js.org/)  is one such wallet that supports the TAO token, and it is a popular choice among users due to its user-friendly interface and range of features.

Once the TAO token has been added to the wallet, users can then send and receive TAO tokens, view their transaction history, and manage other aspects of their TAO holdings directly from their wallet.

After setting up their wallet and adding the TAO token, users can receive TAO tokens to their wallet address and check their TAO balance by using the Bittensor blockchain explorer at  [explorer.finney.opentensor.ai](https://explorer.finney.opentensor.ai/#/accounts). They can also send and receive TAO tokens, as well as manage other aspects of their TAO holdings directly from their wallet.

## Should I move TAO from the Polkadot JS wallet to the Bittensor web wallet?

To clarify, when you set up a Polkadot JS wallet or Bittensor wallet, the TAO tokens are not actually „stored“ in the wallet itself. Instead, the wallet generates a public key and a private key on the blockchain, and the private key gives the wallet owner the ability to control and send TAO tokens on the chain.

This means that when you buy TAO and send them to your wallet’s public address, the tokens are actually stored on the chain, and the wallet simply provides a means for you to access and control them using your private key.

Therefore, there is no need to transfer TAO tokens from a Polkadot JS wallet to a Bittensor wallet, as both wallets generate public and private keys on the same chain. It’s similar to creating two public addresses through a wallet and moving TAO from one address to the other.

It’s important to note that this concept applies to all coins and tokens on any blockchain. Wallets simply provide a user-friendly interface for accessing and controlling tokens using private keys.
